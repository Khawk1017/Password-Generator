# Password-Generator---Challenge-3-

## Project Description
this application is a password generator that once clicked will give a randomly selected lines of text that can be used as a password. The user will go through a series of prompts that will allow them to input the criteria that they want their password to fit, which includes the **character length**,**special characters**, & **numbers**  . After the user chooses options  the browser will then generate a password based of the choices that were made by the user. For this I used javascript to achieve these methods. I created a function that will generate the password using if statements that were determined by the choices were made  so it would return the correct data which were all stored in variables.
